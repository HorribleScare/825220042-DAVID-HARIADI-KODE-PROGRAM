# 🎓 Undergraduate Thesis Program Source Code
This repository contains the source code and supporting files for the Undergraduate Thesis programming assignments developed as part of my academic requirements. The project includes multiple ASP.NET files and questionnaires designed to demonstrate web application logic, data handling, and interface interactions.

The codebase is structured to reflect real-world development practices such as modular views, dynamic pages, and user interaction logic—making it a solid demonstration of both server-side programming and application design.

## 📦 Contents
This project includes:

- Multiple ASP.NET pages (.aspx) for different application modules  
- Questionnaire templates for surveys and assessments  
- Master page layout for consistent UI  
- Role change logic and index navigation  
- Sample dataset files and view components  

The project showcases how web application logic and UI components can be organized in a structured repository.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- ASP.NET (Web Forms)  
- C# (backend logic)  
- Web UI templates and master layouts  

This combination was used to build dynamic server-rendered pages and handle user interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean ASP.NET Web Form architecture  
- Multiple questionnaire and survey pages  
- Master layout page for consistency across views  
- Sample logic for user role changes and navigation  
- Easily extensible for further development  

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis report requirements and contains practical examples of how web applications are structured using ASP.NET. Each page demonstrates a specific aspect of web programming, from UI layout to backend logic for handling data and user interaction. The questionnaires included are useful for capturing user input in structured form and can easily be adapted for other research scenarios.
